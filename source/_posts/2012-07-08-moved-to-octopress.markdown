Blogger was __okay__, but working with code snippets is really painful. With that is mind I've moved over to [Octopress](http://octopress.org) hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/)!

It took me about 2 hours to move, but I probably spent 10 hours researching and deciding what to move to, however I am **VERY** happy with my choice.
